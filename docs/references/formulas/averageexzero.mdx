The `AVERAGEEXZERO` function returns the average (arithmetic mean) of its arguments excluding zeros, which can be numbers or node references.

## Syntax

```javascript
AVERAGEEXZERO (value1,[value2]....)
```

## Arguments

`value1` – The first cell value or number to be averaged. This is a required argument.

`value2, …`  – The additional cells or numbers to be averaged. These are optional arguments.

## Example

Consider sales of a particular product across different regions East, South, Central and West.
Assume that if the sales for a particular period is zero, and the product was withdrawn from the market and hence that region need not be considered when calculating average sales.  

The **Average Sales** is then calculated as:

```javascript
AVERAGEEXZERO (East, South, Central, West)
```
