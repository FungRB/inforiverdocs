title: SWITCH
---

A `SWITCH` statement evaluates an expression against a list of values and returns the result corresponding to the first matching value. 
If there is no match, an optional default value is returned.

## Syntax

```javascript
SWITCH ( expression, value1, result1, value2, result2, ... value_n, result_n, [default] )
```

## Arguments

* `expression` – The statement to be evaluated.
* `value1, value2, … value_n` – The list of values to be compared against the expression.
* `result1, result2, … result_n` – The result to be returned if the expression matches with the corresponding value in the argument list.
* `default` – The default value to be returned if the expression does not match with any of the values in the argument list. This is an optional argument.

## Return value

Returns the corresponding result when the expression matches with value, default in case there was no match.

## Remark

All result expressions and the else expression must be of the same data type.

## Example

Consider a scenario where you have the rank for Total Sales for different regions and want to assign Sales Commission accordingly. Sales Commission for 1st, 2nd and 3rd regions should be 20%, 15% and 10%.

The formula should be:

```javascript
SWITCH(Total Sales – Rank,1,0.2,2,0.15,3,0.1)
```

| Account                 | US  | APAC | EMEA |
|-------------------------|-----|------|------|
| Total Sales - Rank      | 1   | 3    | 2    |
| <b>Sales Commission</b> | 20% | 10%  | 15%  |

The result is the in the 'Sales Commission' row.
